# Giemeks
The purpose of this is to try out JMX avalanches and generate JMX strings, limiting the trial and error for more complex JMX sequences as well as saving time typing 'SYM2,(...)' and not having to use pen and paper.

## Instructions
Click the green symbol box you would like to place.
Click on the board to place it.
To simulate a win (symbol explosion), use the NONE -box.

### Blue AVA button:
Do an avalanche.
### EXTRACT: 
Generate JMX from current symbol positions.
### INSERT: 
Put JMX string in the text field and press this button to see it on the field.
### ExDROP: 
After an avalanche and then replacing emtpy squares with symbols, use this to get JMX for the drop.
